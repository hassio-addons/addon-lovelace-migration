This add-on automatically converts your existing UI to the new Lovelace UI.

## About

The new Lovelace UI for Home Assistant is here, and it is extremely fast,
extremely customizable and extremely extensible.

Building the Lovelace UI configuration from scratch can be a bit of a
daunting task, so this add-on helps create a starting point to work from.
In most cases you will only need to run this add-on once, but if ever you
do you need to run it again, backups of your existing `ui-lovelace.yaml` file
are automatically created and maintained.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "Lovelace Migration" add-on
1. Start the "Lovelace Migration" add-on
1. Navigate to <http://your.domain.com:8123/lovelace> to see the new UI.

**NOTE**: Do not add this repository to Hass.io, please use:
`https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository`.

## Configuration

Even though this add-on is just a basic add-on, it does come with some
configuration options to play around with.

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Lovelace Migration add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "output": "/config/ui-lovelace.yaml",
  "auto_backups": true,
  "init_commands": [],
  "post_commands": []
}
```

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `output`

Sets the output file location of the Lovelace config. If the file exists, it
will automatically be backed up. This value is set to
`/config/ui-lovelace.yaml` by default.

### Option: `auto_backups`

This option allows you to enable/disable automated backups. Each time
the add-on runs, it will ensure your existing Lovelace configuration is
stored safely in the `/backups/lovelace-migration` folder.

### Option: `init_commands`

These commands are executed _before_ the Lovelace config file is generated. This
is useful if you want to keep the backup files in a separate location.

### Option: `post_commands`

These commands are executed _after_ the Lovelace config file is generated. This
is useful if you want to keep the backup files in a separate location.
